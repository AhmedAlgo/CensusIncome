# Census Income
Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Adult Census Income
A dataset was based on the 1994 and 1995 US Census bureau was used for this project. For the purposes of the project, two approaches have been taking in consideration. The first approach was to analyse the dataset as is without any modifications whatsoever. The second approach was to perform some modifications and run a couple algorithms on that dataset. Finally, the three algorithms with the highest accuracy were identified
